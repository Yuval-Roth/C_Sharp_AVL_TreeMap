# C_Sharp_AVLTree
A complete implementation of a generic AVLTree&lt;Key,Data> where Key implements IComparable

The recursive version is the original version of the tree, which makes it slightly more dated, but better tested.

The iterative version differs mostly in the Add() and search() which were turned into iterative methods.
the rest of the methods are already iterative hence not much has changed when transforming the tree into an iterative tree.
